# Contributing

Thanks for helping build The Vine. This project values clarity, simplicity, and
high-quality user experience.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add Firebase values
3. Start the app with `npm start`

## Development Workflow

- Create a feature branch: `feature/short-description`
- Keep commits small and focused
- Run checks before opening a PR

## Checks

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run format`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run typecheck`

## Code Style

- Two-space indentation
- Max line length 100
- Single quotes for strings
- Prefer clear, self-documenting code over clever code
