### Fix Tree Connectors + Zoom Bounds
- **Agent:** Codex
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Working On:** Tree connector alignment, spouse spacing, zoom boundary logic
- **Files:** app/(tabs)/tree.tsx, src/components/tree/FamilyUnitNode.tsx, HANDOFF.md, .codex/*
- **Started:** 2026-02-07T04:14:12Z
- **Blockers:** None
- **Notes:** Deterministic layout refactor complete; TreeNode fixed size constants now exported via tree index to avoid undefined layout sizes (stacking). Added rail-span fix and ensured maxScale >= 1. Needs verification.
