## Summary
Last commit: `dfc20aa` on `main`
> fix: make .mcp.json device-specific (auto-generated by sync scripts)

Untrack .mcp.json and add to .gitignore since it contains absolute paths
and device-specific model selection. Sync scripts now auto-generate it
with the correct path and model (7b on Mac, 14b on Windows) based on
what Ollama reports locally.

## AI Summary
This commit fixes the issue where `.mcp.json` was not device-specific, making it contain absolute paths and device-specific model selections. The changes include updating sync scripts to auto-generate this file with the correct path and model based on local Ollama reports (7b for Mac and 14b for Windows). The `.mcp.json` file is now untracked and added to `.gitignore`. Developers should ensure their device-specific settings are correctly configured by running the sync scripts.
